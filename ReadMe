Hello!

My app is built with React and tested using Jest. To get started, cd in the the folder where you've cloned this project.
  - Type npm install.
    - This will set up the Jest test suite.
  - Type npm test.
    - This will run the tests that I've created.

You can find all files in the source (src) folder.
  - babySitter.js => contains the logic for the babysitter calculator.
  - babySitter.test.js => contains the code for the tests.


Happy testing!
